'starlight-package-managers': minor

Changes the default order of default package managers to be alphabetical (`npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn` instead of `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm`).

If you want to preserve the previous behaviour, you can check the [“Global Customization” guide](https://starlight-package-managers.vercel.app/guides/package-managers#global-customization) and manually specify the package managers order you want.
