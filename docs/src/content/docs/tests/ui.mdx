import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import PackageManagers from '../../../components/PackageManagers.astro'

export const pkg = 'astro'

Two consecutive commands using `starlight-package-managers`:

<PackageManagers pkg={pkg} />

<PackageManagers pkg={pkg} />

Some text in between.

<PackageManagers pkg={pkg} />

Some more text.

Some code followed by a command:

```ts
export const pkg = 'astro'
```

<PackageManagers pkg={pkg} />

And a command with only 1 package manager:

<PackageManagers pkg={pkg} pkgManagers={['pnpm']} />

And a command with no icons:

<PackageManagers pkg={pkg} icons={false} />
