## Installation

Install the Starlight Package Managers component using your favorite package manager:

<PackageManagers pkg="starlight-package-managers" />

:::note
When using a [strict package manager](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-vs-npm#npms-flat-tree) like pnpm, you will also need to install the [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/) syntax highlighter so it can be found during builds:

<PackageManagers pkg="shiki" pkgManagers={['pnpm']} />

:::

## Basic Usage

You can now use the component in any MDX files of your Starlight documentation site.

```mdx
